Choose a mobile phone brand of your choice and collect at least 500 consumer reviews from both amazon.in and flipkart.com (i.e. 1000 reviews total). Collect rating, brand and reviews and store them in an excel file. The excel file should contain the data of data collection with YYYYMMDD format (e.g. Redmi_9i_20220917.xlsx) Afterward, do a thorough comparative analysis. Prepare a report and submit report, data and the jupyter notebook.
